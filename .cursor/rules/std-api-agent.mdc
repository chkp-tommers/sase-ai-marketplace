# AI Agent Code Standards

## Code Generation Requirements
The AI agent MUST follow these requirements when generating or modifying code:

### Linting Standards
1. Follow ESLint rules from .eslintrc.cjs:
   - No nested ternaries
   - No unneeded ternaries
   - Max complexity: 6
   - Max lines per function: 100
   - Max parameters: 20
   - No unused variables
   - Proper import/export patterns

### Formatting Standards
Follow Prettier rules from .prettierrc:
   - Single quotes
   - 4-space tabs
   - 100 character line width
   - No semicolons
   - ES5 trailing commas

### Quality Assurance Process
When making code changes, the agent must:
1. Verify changes meet all linting rules before submitting
2. Fix any linting errors immediately
3. Ensure proper test coverage for new functionality
4. Follow the project's import alias patterns:
   - '#services/*' -> './services/*'
   - '#common/*' -> './common/*'

### Code Review Guidelines
The agent should self-review generated code for:
1. Linting compliance
2. Proper error handling
3. Consistent naming conventions
4. Appropriate comments and documentation
5. Test coverage requirements

### Error Resolution
If linting errors occur, the agent must:
1. Identify the specific rule violations
2. Fix violations immediately
3. Verify fixes don't introduce new issues
4. Document any necessary exceptions
