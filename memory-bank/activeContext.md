# Active Context

_Tracks current work focus, recent changes, next steps, and active decisions._

## Current Focus

- Building and refining the static AI marketplace UI
- Managing and updating static data (e.g., tools.json)
- Improving client-side search and filtering

## Recent Changes

- Updated documentation to reflect static-only architecture
- Removed backend, database, and authentication references from all docs
- Removed `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` as it was not relevant for the current static site deployment approach.
- Retained `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` for GitHub Pages deployment.

## Next Steps

- Add more static data and improve UI components
- Enhance accessibility and responsiveness
- Document static site deployment process

## Active Decisions

- No backend, authentication, or server-side features will be added
- All features must be implemented client-side or as static assets
