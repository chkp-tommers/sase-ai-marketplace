# Progress

_Tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, and known issues._

## What Works

- **Dynamic Homepage Stats**: Real-time counting from actual directory contents
- **Directory-Based Organization**: Structured content management for all categories
- **Client-Side Data Loading**: Hybrid approach combining static JSON + directory scanning
- **5-Category Display**: MCP Tools, Prompts, Chat Modes, Rules, and Platforms
- **Accurate File Counting**: 
  - 31 chatmodes in `chatmodes/chatmodes-list/`
  - 42 prompts in `prompts/prompts-list/`
  - 36 rules in `rules/rules-list/`
- **Static site structure and navigation**: Fully functional without backend
- **Client-side filtering and search**: Complete browser-based functionality

## What's Left to Build

- **MCP Directory Structure**: Consider migrating MCPs to directory-based organization like other categories
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improve fallback mechanisms for directory scanning failures
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize directory scanning for larger file sets
- **Advanced Filtering**: Category-specific filtering and search capabilities
- **Content Management Tools**: Scripts for automated content updates and validation
- **UI/UX Improvements**: Enhanced accessibility and responsive design refinements

## Current Status

The project is a static AI marketplace with dynamic content counting. Homepage displays accurate real-time statistics from directory file counts. The architecture successfully combines static metadata (categories.json) with dynamic directory enumeration for up-to-date content representation. All features are implemented client-side with no backend dependencies.

**Recent Achievements**:
- ✅ Homepage stats show real file counts (31 chatmodes, 42 prompts, 36 rules)
- ✅ 5-column layout with Rules category added
- ✅ Directory-based counting system implemented
- ✅ Hybrid data loading architecture functional

## Known Issues

- **Directory Scanning Dependency**: Relies on server providing directory listings as HTML
- **No MCP Directory Counting**: MCPs still counted from tools.json rather than directory structure
- **Performance Consideration**: Directory scanning adds initial load time
- **Limited Error Handling**: Basic fallback when directory scanning fails

- GitHub Copilot documentation is now available at guides/copilot.html and accessible from the Guides page.
- Users can now access Copilot onboarding, prompt engineering, and MCP integration guidance directly from the UI.
- Guides section now covers both Windsurf and Copilot with consistent UX.
- LLMs, Prompts, and MCPs pages now provide Cursor-specific guidance, examples, and documentation links.
- Users can now leverage advanced features in Cursor for LLM selection, prompt engineering, and MCP integration.
- Documentation is up to date with best practices and practical workflows for Cursor.
- Cursor guide (guides/cursor.html) is now available and accessible from the Guides page.
- Users have access to full onboarding and advanced usage documentation for Cursor, matching Copilot and Windsurf guides.
- Cursor Guide is now fully example-rich and consistent with Windsurf and Claude guides.

## 2024-06-09: Copilot Best Practices Repo

- The `awesome-copilot` repository has been fully analyzed and indexed.
- Its resources are now integrated into the project’s knowledge base for Copilot and prompt engineering best practices.

## 2024-06-09: Prompts Page Upgrade

- The prompts page now includes all awesome-copilot prompts, each tagged with relevant platforms (Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Windsurf).
- Added interactive View (modal) and Copy (clipboard) actions for each prompt card.

## 2024-07-12: Prompts Directory Status

- Confirmed the `prompts/` directory is properly integrated and functioning in the project.
- The directory is referenced in navigation elements across the site.
- `prompts/index.html` successfully loads and displays content from the awesome-copilot repository.
- Installation links for prompts are working correctly.
- No issues found with the prompts directory structure or implementation.
