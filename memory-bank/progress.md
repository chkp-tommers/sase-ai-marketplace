# Progress

_Tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, and known issues._

## What Works

- Static site structure and navigation
- Static data loading (e.g., from JSON files)
- Client-side filtering and search

## What's Left to Build

- Add more AI tools to static data
- Improve UI/UX and accessibility
- Enhance client-side filtering/sorting
- Add documentation and usage guides

## Current Status

The project is a static AI marketplace. All features are implemented client-side, with no backend or server-side logic.

- Dynamic CI/CD pipeline (ci-cd.yml) removed as it was not needed.
- Static deployment via GitHub Pages (`deploy-pages.yml`) is active and current.

## Known Issues
